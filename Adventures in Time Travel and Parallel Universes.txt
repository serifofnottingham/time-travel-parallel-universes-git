When I checked into my hotel room, I saw a small gift-wrapped package sitting squarely in the center of my bed. A small card on top of the package had my name on it, but was otherwise blank. I tore open the wrapping and found a smartphone inside. Oddly enough, although I follow a lot of tech blogs and I'm pretty knowledgable about the latest models, the one in front of me looked completely unfamiliar. It came with no instruction booklet, no accessories, not even a power cord. It was a typical glass brick-style phone, except that it had only a single button on it. After turning the phone over several times to make sure there were no other controls, I tapped the sole button. The screen lit up immediately, and on the display a few icons appeared. I tapped one that looked like a camera. 

A flash of light blinded me temporarily. After blinking a few times, I looked down at the phone to see the photo I had just taken, but the screen displayed two buttons: "Save" and "Discard." I tapped "Save," and a text field appeared with the prompt, "Enter message." I guess I had to give the photo a caption. I entered "My hotel room." Then I was back on the home screen again, with all the icons. Did this piece of junk app just crash? I hoped this was indeed a prototype, otherwise it was a major letdown. Here I had gotten all excited about a mysterious new phone left for me in my hotel room. 

Out of curiosity I tapped an icon with a tee on it, wondering what kind of app would open. A drawing of a tree appeared in the background of the screen, with a bunch of colored lines superimposed on top of the tree branches. I tapped a tree branch labeled "Prank-call." 

For a moment I felt dizzy and disoriented, as though I had stood up too quickly and all of the blood had rushed out of my head. Looking at the phone, the only change I could see was that the Prank-call tree branch was glowing slightly. Was that it? How boring. It was time to put away this worthless glass brick and practice my conference presentation, or maybe run up a tab at the hotel bar.

I was about to drop the phone when it started to ring. Who would call this brand new phone? An impulse to respond to this strangeness with a little weirdness of my own overcame me. I answered the phone, and said, "Geppetto's Pizza, how may I help you?"

"You have figured out how to change branches, now it is time for the next step..." The voice, barely more than a whisper, had a hollow, metallic quality, as if it were traveling halfway around the world over aging copper wires.

"I'm sorry, sir, this is the only branch of Geppetto's Pizza, we don't have any other locations at this time. But, we deliver all over the city. Would you like to try one of our new gluten-free pizzas?"

"I know who you are...there is not need to waste time...you must learn to use the phone..."

"I'm sorry, sir, but I already know how to use a phone, I'm doing it right now. If you don't like pizza, we also have a selection of garden-fresh salads."

"Learn to use this phone...the phone that is more than a phone...there is a clue down the hall, by the ice machine..."

Well, the pizza joke wasn't working on this guy. Time for a different tactic. "Fine, enough joking around. Yes, I got the phone you left me in my hotel room. Did you get the toothbrush I left in yours?"

"You must go find the clue near the ice machine..."

This guy obviously had no sense of humor. I felt like I was talking with a robot. Maybe I was. I hung up the phone and dropped it on the bedside table. As I did so, my thumb slipped and brushed the camera icon on the phone. The phone flashed. 

I felt dizzy, disoriented, and a little queasy. That airplane food I ate on my way in must have done a number on me. I went to the window to get some fresh air. As I leaned out from the fourth floor window and inhaled deeply, I started to feel better. I looked down at the street below, and suddenly felt the phone slip from my grasp. I heard it start to ring as it plummeted down, until it smashed into the pavement below and went silent.
